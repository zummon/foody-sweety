**Ingredients:**

* **For the Chocolate Cake:**  
  * All-purpose flour  
  * Unsweetened cocoa powder (for rich chocolate flavor)  
  * Granulated sugar  
  * Baking powder  
  * Baking soda  
  * Salt  
  * Eggs  
  * Milk or buttermilk (for moisture)  
  * Vegetable oil or melted butter  
  * Vanilla extract  
  * Hot water or brewed coffee (to enhance chocolate flavor)  
* **For the Dark Chocolate Ganache:**  
  * Dark chocolate (high-quality)  
  * Heavy cream  
* **For Decoration:**  
  * Fresh raspberries

**Equipment:**

* Mixing bowls (various sizes)  
* Whisk  
* Electric mixer (hand or stand)  
* Rubber spatula  
* Measuring cups and spoons  
* Sifter (optional, for dry ingredients)  
* Cake pans (round, typically 8 or 9 inches)  
* Parchment paper  
* Cooling racks  
* Serrated knife or cake leveler (for leveling cake layers)  
* Offset spatula or knife (for frosting)  
* Small saucepan (for ganache)

**How to Make It (General Method):**

1. **Prepare the Cake Batter:**  
   * Preheat oven and grease and flour (or line with parchment) cake pans.  
   * Whisk together dry ingredients (flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt).  
   * In a separate bowl, combine wet ingredients (eggs, milk/buttermilk, oil/butter, vanilla).  
   * Gradually add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.  
   * Stir in hot water or coffee (this thins the batter but intensifies the chocolate flavor).  
   * Divide batter evenly among prepared pans.  
2. **Bake the Cakes:**  
   * Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  
   * Let cakes cool in pans for a few minutes before inverting them onto cooling racks to cool completely.  
3. **Make the Dark Chocolate Ganache:**  
   * Finely chop the dark chocolate.  
   * Heat heavy cream in a saucepan until simmering.  
   * Pour hot cream over chopped chocolate and let it sit for a minute or two to melt the chocolate.  
   * Whisk gently until smooth and glossy.  
   * Let the ganache cool slightly to thicken (but not solidify).  
4. **Assemble the Cake:**  
   * Level the tops of the cake layers with a serrated knife if needed.  
   * Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand.  
   * Spread a layer of ganache over the first layer.  
   * Top with the second cake layer and repeat with remaining layers and ganache.  
   * Pour the remaining ganache over the top of the cake, allowing it to drip down the sides.  
   * Decorate with fresh raspberries.

**Key Considerations for this Decadent Cake:**

* **High-Quality Ingredients:** Using good quality cocoa powder and dark chocolate will significantly impact the flavor.  
* **Don't Overmix:** Overmixing the batter can lead to a tough cake.  
* **Cool Completely:** Make sure the cake layers are completely cool before frosting to prevent the ganache from melting.  
* **Ganache Consistency:** The ganache should be thick enough to coat the cake but still pourable. Adjust the ratio of chocolate to cream if needed.

This provides a solid base for baking a delicious chocolate layer cake with ganache. There are many variations on this classic, but this should give you a good starting point.
