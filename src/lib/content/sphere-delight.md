**Instructions:**

**Make the Chocolate Sphere:**

1. **Melt the Chocolate:** Finely chop the dark chocolate. In a double boiler or heatproof bowl over simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring occasionally until smooth.  
2. **Add Cream and Butter:** Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in the heavy cream and butter until fully incorporated. Stir in the vanilla extract.  
3. **Pour into Mold:** Pour the chocolate mixture into the sphere mold, ensuring it fills each cavity.  
4. **Chill:** Place the mold in the freezer for at least 2 hours, or until the chocolate is completely set.

**Make the Vanilla Ice Cream:**

1. **Chill the Cream:** Pour the heavy cream into a metal bowl and place it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes.  
2. **Whisk Cream and Sugar:** Remove the bowl from the freezer and whisk in the granulated sugar and vanilla bean paste until stiff peaks form.  
3. **Freeze in Ice Cream Maker:** Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.  
4. **Transfer to Freezer:** Once the ice cream is churned, transfer it to an airtight container and freeze for at least 4 hours, or overnight.

**Make the Chocolate Sauce:**

1. **Heat Cream:** In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it just begins to simmer.  
2. **Add Chocolate:** Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the chopped dark chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the1 sauce is smooth.

**Assemble the Dessert:**

2. **Plate:** Place a scoop of vanilla ice cream on a plate. Top with a half of the chocolate sphere. Drizzle with chocolate sauce and place a few chocolate truffles around the plate.

**Enjoy\!**

**Tips:**

* You can use a piping bag to make the chocolate sphere if you don't have a mold.  
* For a richer flavor, use dark chocolate with a higher cocoa content.  
* If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can freeze the ice cream mixture in a loaf pan and then scoop it out as needed.  
* To store the dessert, keep the ice cream and truffles frozen, and the chocolate spheres and sauce in the refrigerator.
