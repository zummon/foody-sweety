**Likely Techniques and Components:**

* **Spherification (for the large sphere):** This is the most prominent technique. It involves creating liquid spheres with a thin, gel-like membrane. There are two main types:  
  * **Basic Spherification:** A liquid containing sodium alginate is dropped into a calcium chloride bath, forming a sphere.  
  * **Reverse Spherification:** A liquid containing calcium lactate is dropped into a sodium alginate bath. This is better for liquids with high calcium content.  
  * *Likely Ingredient:* Fruit puree (mango, passion fruit, or similar) or a flavored syrup.  
* **Gelification (for the black base):** This creates a solid or semi-solid gel.  
  * *Likely Ingredients:* Agar-agar (vegetarian), gelatin (non-vegetarian), or other gelling agents like gellan gum. The black color could be achieved with activated charcoal or black food coloring.  
* **Fluid Gel (for the yellow swirl):** A gel that has been blended to a smooth, flowing consistency.  
  * *Likely Ingredients:* Similar gelling agents as above, possibly with added stabilizers. The yellow color could be from fruit puree or food coloring.  
* **Edible Spheres/Pearls (small, colorful elements):** These are likely made using spherification techniques, often called "caviar" due to their small size.  
  * *Likely Ingredients:* Fruit juices, flavored syrups, or vegetable purees.  
* **Microgreens/Herbs (green elements):** These add a fresh element and visual contrast.  
  * *Likely Ingredients:* Small leaves or sprouts like micro cilantro, parsley, or other herbs.

**Equipment (Essential for Molecular Gastronomy):**

* **Sodium Alginate:** A natural extract from brown seaweed used for spherification.  
* **Calcium Chloride or Calcium Lactate:** Used in conjunction with sodium alginate for spherification.  
* **Syringes or Pipettes:** For precise dropping of liquids into baths.  
* **Spoons with hemispherical molds:** For shaping spheres.  
* **Immersion blender:** For blending gels into fluid gels.  
* **Digital scale:** For accurate measurements (crucial in molecular gastronomy).  
* **Various bowls, containers, and molds.**

**General Method (Conceptual):**

1. **Prepare the Sphere:**  
   * Mix the chosen liquid with either sodium alginate (for basic spherification) or calcium lactate (for reverse spherification).  
   * Create a bath with the opposite calcium/alginate solution.  
   * Carefully drop the liquid into the bath using a syringe or spoon.  
   * Allow the spheres to form for the specified time.  
   * Rinse the spheres in water to remove excess bath solution.  
2. **Prepare the Black Base:**  
   * Mix the gelling agent with water and other flavorings/colorings.  
   * Heat and then chill to set.  
   * Cut into the desired shape.  
3. **Prepare the Fluid Gel and Other Elements:**  
   * Follow specific instructions for each element, using appropriate gelling agents and techniques.  
4. **Assemble the Dish:**  
   * Carefully arrange the black base on the plate.  
   * Place the sphere on top.  
   * Use a syringe or piping bag to create the fluid gel swirl.  
   * Scatter the edible spheres/pearls and microgreens around the plate.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Precision is Key:** Molecular gastronomy relies on precise measurements and timing.  
* **Specialized Ingredients:** You'll need to source specialized ingredients like sodium alginate and calcium chloride.  
* **Experimentation:** Molecular gastronomy is about experimenting and exploring different textures and flavors.

This is a very general overview. Actual recipes for molecular gastronomy dishes can be quite complex. If you're interested in trying this at home, I recommend looking for specific recipes and tutorials online from reputable sources specializing in molecular gastronomy.
