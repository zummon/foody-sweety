* Electric mixer (hand or stand)  
* Rubber spatula  
* Spoons  
* Piping bags (optional, for precise plating)  
* Small molds or ring molds (for shaping the jelly and foam)  
* Spatula or palette knife (for plating)

**How to Make It (General Method):**

1. **Prepare the Coffee Jelly:**  
   * Combine brewed coffee, sugar, and gelatin (or agar-agar) in a saucepan.  
   * Heat gently, stirring until the gelatin dissolves.  
   * Pour into small molds or a shallow dish and chill until set.  
   * Cut into desired shapes (cubes or small discs).  
2. **Make the Mascarpone Foam:**  
   * Whip heavy cream until soft peaks form.  
   * In a separate bowl, whisk mascarpone with sugar until smooth.  
   * Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture.  
   * If using, whisk egg whites to stiff peaks and gently fold them in.  
   * If using gelatin, bloom it and incorporate it into the mixture for extra stability.  
   * Transfer to a piping bag or leave in a bowl.  
3. **Prepare the Ladyfinger Crumble:**  
   * Lightly crush or pulse ladyfingers in a food processor to create a coarse crumble.  
   * Optional: Toss the crumble with melted butter and sugar and toast it lightly in the oven for extra flavor and texture.  
4. **Assemble the Dessert:**  
   * This is where the artistic plating comes in. Use the image as inspiration.  
   * Place a portion of coffee jelly in the center of the plate.  
   * Pipe or spoon the mascarpone foam over or around the jelly.  
   * Scatter the ladyfinger crumble around the plate.  
   * Garnish with white chocolate elements (shapes or shavings), a dusting of cocoa powder, and a drizzle of caramel sauce.

**Key Considerations for this Modern Interpretation:**

* **Deconstruction:** The key is to present the components separately, allowing the diner to combine them.  
* **Texture Contrast:** The dish plays with different textures: smooth jelly, airy foam, crunchy crumble, and solid chocolate.  
* **Visual Appeal:** Plating is crucial. Use the image as a guide for an artistic and balanced presentation.  
* **Flavor Balance:** The bitterness of the coffee should be balanced by the sweetness of the mascarpone and other elements.

This is a general guide. A professional chef might use more advanced techniques or specific ingredients. However, this breakdown should give you a good starting point for understanding how this modern tiramisu is constructed.
