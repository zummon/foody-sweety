**How to Make It (General Method):**

1. **Prepare the Broth (This is the most time-consuming part):**  
   * **For Tonkotsu (Pork Bone Broth):** Simmer pork bones in water for several hours (4-6 or even longer) to extract flavor and create a rich, milky broth. This often involves multiple stages of boiling and discarding water to remove impurities.  
   * **For Simpler Broths:** Sauté aromatics (onion, garlic, ginger) in a pot. Add broth (chicken or vegetable), soy sauce, miso (if using), mirin (if using), and dried shiitake (if using). Simmer for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Strain the broth before serving.  
2. **Cook the Pork:**  
   * **For Chashu (Braised Pork):** Braise pork belly or shoulder in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and ginger until tender. Then slice thinly.  
   * **For Simpler Preparation:** Simply sear or pan-fry thinly sliced cooked pork.  
3. **Cook the Eggs:**  
   * Bring a pot of water to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook for 6-7 minutes for soft-boiled eggs.  
   * Immediately transfer the eggs to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Peel the eggs and cut them in half.  
4. **Prepare the Noodles:**  
   * Cook ramen noodles according to package directions. Be careful not to overcook them; they should be al dente.  
5. **Prepare the Vegetables:**  
   * Blanch or lightly sauté the broccoli florets and other vegetables.  
6. **Assemble the Ramen:**  
   * Place cooked noodles in a bowl.  
   * Pour hot broth over the noodles.  
   * Arrange the pork slices, soft-boiled egg halves, and vegetables on top of the noodles.  
   * Garnish with green onions, sesame seeds, and chili oil (if using).
